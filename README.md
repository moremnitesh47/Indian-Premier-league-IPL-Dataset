# Indian-Premier-league-IPL-Dataset
IPL is among the most famous cricket league with players coming from worldwide. What makes this series more competitive every year is the drama with every ball and hence this dataset is a complete dataset showing match information and also data for each delivery.



# Machine learning
This system uses machinelearning libraries and tools to proeces data and predict the probability.
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine Learning, as the name says, is all about machines learning automatically without being explicitly programmed or learning without any direct human intervention.

<b>Linear Regression</b>

It is one of the supervised Machine learning algorithms in Python that observes
continuous features and predicts an outcome. Depending on whether it runs on a
single variable or on many features, we can call it simple linear regression or
multiple linear regression. This is one of the most popular Python ML algorithms
and often under-appreciated. It assigns optimal weights to variables to create a line
ax+b to predict the output. We often use linear regression to estimate real values
like a number of calls and costs of houses based on continuous variables. The
regression line is the best line that fits Y=a*X+b to denote a relationship between
independent and dependent variable

# Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source app framework for creating and deploying data science applications. Streamlit helps data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop performant applications in a few hours, thereby enabling businesses to create custom applications and interact with the data in their models.
Streamlit is an open source app framework in python language. It helps us create beautiful web-apps for data science and machine learning in a little time.

# Conclusion
 I conclude that the dataset is not a complete space, and there are still other feature vectors missing from it. What, I was attempting to generalize is a subspace of the actual input space, where the other dimensions are not known, and hence none of the classifiers were able to do better than 71.6% (Naïve Bayes). In the future, if similar studies are conducted to generate the dataset used in this project, more feature vectors need to be calculated so that the classifiers can form a better idea of the problem at hand.
